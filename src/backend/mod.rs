//! Backend abstraction for tensor operations.
//!
//! This module provides the backend trait and storage types that allow the tensor
//! library to support multiple compute backends (CPU, WGPU, CUDA). The backend
//! system is designed to be extensible and allows seamless switching between
//! different hardware accelerators.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`Backend`]: The trait that all backends must implement
//! - [`Storage`]: An enum that holds backend-specific storage implementations
//! - [`BACKENDS`]: A global list of available backends, initialized lazily
//!
//! Backends are selected automatically based on availability, with preference
//! given to GPU backends (CUDA, then WGPU) before falling back to CPU.

/// The main backend trait that all compute backends must implement.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for tensor operations across different
/// hardware backends. Each backend is responsible for:
/// - Creating tensors (zeros, ones, from data)
/// - Performing arithmetic operations
/// - Performing reductions and transformations
/// - Converting between storage formats
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// Backends should be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) and implement `Debug` for
/// diagnostic purposes. The `is_available` method allows backends to report
/// whether they can be used on the current system.
